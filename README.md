Hello below i hope to have provided all the labs/functions i was tasked with creating during my studys, hopefully i didnt miss any task/labs if i have i am sorry.
Week 1 to my memory didnt have any coding task as it was an introduction to the class and getting everything setup,
Week 2 - Week 7 should have all the codes/functions.
I have split all the codes into files and named them from 1-15, i have very basic docstrings explaning my basic understanding of what the task is supposed to complete.
I have provided more details on the codes/functions that required more explanation.
